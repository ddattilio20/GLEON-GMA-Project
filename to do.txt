To do:

1. Long to wide casting
    -code to cast wide to long
    -build upload csv template for long data
    -
2. Fix data not loading in site 
3. 









Notes:

-Heroku falls asleep after 30 mins of inactivity
-free tier heroku has 2 types, unverified and verified
    -verified means you have card details verified (gets you 1000 hours of activity per month)
    -unverified 550 hours of dyno per month




- Slow load times for site modules
    potential fixes:
        - move import statements around to lessen first load times
        -


-not all data is getting loaded into charts on site
    -one part most likely due to lat/long in wrong format
    -other than that not sure atm
